# Burger Order App

A simple react app built to learn more about react and test features and libraries I'm interested in learning more about

### Decisions

- Use Storybook for quick feedback while building components
- Using useReducer and useContext hooks instead of Redux because this is a small application and using Redux is more than is required for this application
- Using react-bootstrap rather than a component library like material-ui to provide quick and easy components, so I can spend less time on styling and moore time adding features

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start` runs the app in the development mode at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test`
- `yarn build`

## Packages/Libraries Used

- [storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com)
- [uuid](https://github.com/uuidjs/uuid)

### Planned Packages/Libraries to Use

- [react-a11y](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y) / [react-axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/react-axe)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Update README for new git commit
